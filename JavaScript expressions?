console.log(typeof NaN);
console.log(typeof Infinity);
console.log(1 / -0);

Correct Answer :
"number", "number", -Infinity


Answer Explanation :
-- typeof NaN returns "number", as NaN (Not a Number) is still considered a number type in JavaScript.

-- typeof Infinity also returns "number", as Infinity is a special numeric value in JavaScript.

-- 1 / -0 evaluates to -Infinity, as dividing by negative zero results in negative infinity in JavaScript.
