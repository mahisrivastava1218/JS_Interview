Enables strict mode.

Catches common mistakes (e.g., undeclared variables).

Prevents usage of reserved keywords.

Makes your code more secure and predictable.

👉 Example:

"use strict";
x = 10; // ❌ Error: x is not defined
Without "use strict", it would create a global variable silently — which is risky.
