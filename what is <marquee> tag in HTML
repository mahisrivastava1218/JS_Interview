<marquee> is an old HTML tag used to create scrolling text or images (like a news ticker).

It moves content left to right, right to left, up, or down automatically.

⚠️ It is deprecated (not recommended in modern HTML), but still works in most browsers.

Instead of <marquee>, developers now use CSS animations.

🔹 Modern Alternative (Using CSS Animation)

Since <marquee> is outdated, here’s the modern way:

  <style>
    .marquee {
      width: 100%;
      overflow: hidden;
      white-space: nowrap;
      box-sizing: border-box;
      animation: marquee 10s linear infinite;
    }

    @keyframes marquee {
      from { transform: translateX(100%); }
      to { transform: translateX(-100%); }
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="marquee">🚀 This is a modern marquee effect using CSS animation 🚀</div>
</body>
