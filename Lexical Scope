Lexical scope means that a function can access variables from the place where it was defined, not from where it is called.

ðŸ§  JavaScript uses lexical (static) scoping, so inner functions can access outer function variables.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
function outer() {
  let name = "Mahi";
  function inner() {
    console.log(name); // âœ… Access allowed
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
inner() can access name because it's defined inside outer() â€” this is lexical scope.
