Template literals are string literals that allow embedded expressions (variables) into your code. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single (') or double (") quotes.

It was introduced in ES6, which provides a more flexible and readable way to work with strings. Unlike traditional string concatenation, template literals simplify the process of embedding expressions, multi-line strings, and variable interpolation.

Syntax

`string text ${expression} string text`
Backticks (``): Used to define a template literal.
${}: Used to insert expressions inside the string, such as variables, function calls, or arithmetic operations.
