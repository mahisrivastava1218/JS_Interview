Parameters refer to the variables listed in a function's declaration, defining the input that the function can accept. Arguments, however, are the actual values 
passed to the function when it is called, filling the parameters during execution.
def add(x, y):  # Here, x and y are parameters
    return x + y



Arguments, also known as actual arguments, are the values supplied to a function when it is called. These values serve as inputs to the function during its execution.

They are used to supply the values to the parameters of a function. The number of arguments must match the number of parameters in the function definition.

Example:

result = add(5, 3)  # Here, 5 and 3 are arguments
