In JavaScript, string immutability refers to the characteristic that once a string value is created, its content cannot be directly altered or modified. Instead, 
any operation that appears to "change" a string, such as replace(), toUpperCase(), or concatenation, actually results in the creation of a new string in memory, 
leaving the original string untouched.
