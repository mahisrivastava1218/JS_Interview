✅ Primitive Data Types
➡️ Basic, immutable data. Stored by value.

📦 Examples:

String

Number

Boolean

null

undefined

Symbol

BigInt

📌 Example:
let a = 5;
let b = a;
b = 10;
console.log(a); // 5 (unchanged)

✅ Non-Primitive Data Types
➡️ Complex, mutable data. Stored by reference.

📦 Examples:

Object

Array

Function

Date, Map, Set, etc.

📌 Example:

let obj1 = { name: "Mahi" };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Amit";
console.log(obj1.name); // "Amit" (both refer to same object)
🧠 Quick Difference:

Primitive = stored by value
Non-Primitive = stored by reference
