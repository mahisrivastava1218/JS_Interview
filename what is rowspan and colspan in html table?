In HTML tables, rowspan is used to merge cells vertically (across rows), and colspan is used to merge cells horizontally (across columns).

Example:
<td rowspan="2" colspan="3">Merged</td> â€” This cell spans 2 rows and 3 columns.

In JavaScript, we can access them using:
element.rowSpan and element.colSpan.
